<p>After you make a fast web site, keep it fast by measuring it over time. Read <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/">Use Speedlify to Continuously Measure Site Performance</a>. Created by <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/">@zachleat</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires Node 12+</li>
<li>Each file in <code>_data/sites/*.js</code> is a category and contains a list of sites for comparison.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Run locally</h2>
<p><em>After cloning you’ll probably want to delete the initial <code>_data/sites/*.js</code> files and create your own file with a list of your own site URLs!</em></p>
<pre><code>npm install
npm run test-pages
npm run start
</code></pre>

<h2>Deploy to Netlify</h2>
<p>Can run directly on Netlify (including your tests) and will save the results to a Netlify build cache (via Netlify Build Plugins, see <code>plugins/keep-data-cache/</code>).</p>
<p><em>After cloning you’ll probably want to delete the initial <code>_data/sites/*.js</code> files and create your own file with a list of your own site URLs!</em></p>

<p>Speedlify will also save your data to <code>/results.zip</code> so that you can download later. Though this has proved to be unnecessary so far, it does serve as a fallback backup mechanism in case the Netlify cache is lost. Just look up your previous build URL and download the data to restore.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Run every day or week</strong>: You can set Speedlify to run at a specified interval using a Netlify Build Hook, read more on the Eleventy docs: <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/netlify-ifttt/">Quick Tip #008—Trigger a Netlify Build Every Day with IFTTT</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you change a URL to remove a redirect (to remove or add a <code>www.</code>, moved domains, etc), you probably want to delete the old URL’s data otherwise you’ll have two entries in the results list.</li>
<li>When running on Netlify, a single category has a max limit on the number of sites it can test, upper bound on how many tests it can complete in the 15 minute Netlify build limit.</li>
<li>The same URL cannot be listed in two different categories (yet).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pay for something better</h2>
<p>Speedlify is intended as a stepping stone to more robust performance monitoring solutions like:</p>
